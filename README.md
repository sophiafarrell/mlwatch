- List of dimensions: In `dimensions.md` you will find a rolling-list of the dimensions at play in the files used for the project. 
- In `data`: There is a file called `data_preprocessing.py` that has all the tools that I used to get data into the inital format to feed into ML algorithms and data loaders.
